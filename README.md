# Restaurant
JavaScript Project. Website for fictional Restaurant, which is located on the boat in the middle of the ocean 

In this team project, we were given a task to create a website using only simple JavaScript, HTML and CSS, no frameworks, no outside scripts. My part was to developed two pages: Gift Cards and Locations. Even though looking back at the code now and seeing how much I can improve it, I am still very proud of this project, because it was truly the first time I worked in the team on a fairly large project. To be successful as a team we communicated a lot and used GitHub to collaborate and put our code together.
